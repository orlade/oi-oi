# Oi Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orlade/oi-oi.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/orlade/oi-sysl)

An [Oi](https://github.com/orlade/oi) plugin to run development tasks on Oi itself.

Oi plugins are typically named using the `@oi` scope followed by `oi-<foo>`, where `foo` is a 
logical grouping of commands, such as a project. In this case the project is Oi, hence the name.

## Usage

    npm install -g @oi/oi @oi/oi-oi
    oi oi -h
